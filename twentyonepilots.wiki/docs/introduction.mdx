# 04/20/18 - Vessel gif changed

The [gif/video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IigZXFhkbMM) used on the [Vessel tab](https://store.twentyonepilots.com/vessel.html) of the twenty one pilots store site was replaced with one containing an incomplete link: [https://dmaorg.info/found/⁙_./clancy.html](https://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html). This corresponds to the first eye tweeted before the hiatus: “You’ll have to come and find me.”

The [Vessel gif](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/difficultoldfashionedantarcticfurseals) was first discovered by reddit user Jake Dello ([/u/jakedello](https://www.reddit.com/u/jakedello)). The domain ([dmaorg.info](http://dmaorg.info)) linked to an error site with the message:

![Violation code](./assets/violationcode.png)

When you copy the violation code into the url, you get the main dmaorg site: http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html

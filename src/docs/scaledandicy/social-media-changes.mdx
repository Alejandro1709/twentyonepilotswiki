## 01/07/21 to 03/31/21 - Twitter header desaturation

On January 7th, 2021, the band updated their Twitter, Youtube, and official website headers to an image that could be found earlier on in an AltPress interview magazine (#384). The photo was taken during a show of the Trench era. A bright red filter was initially applied over it, as well as the band’s yellow Trench logo.

![_they_ca_ntseeFCE300.gif](./assets/_they_ca_ntseeFCE300.gif)

**File name:** _they_ca_ntseeFCE300.gif

**Additional Info:**

- “FCE300” is the hexadecimal code for a specific shade of yellow. The file name, along with the previous journal, suggests that the bishops or the “watchers” are unable to see this color.

- This update correlates to the last eye tweet, from “Car Radio” : *“And now I just sit in silence”* (a reference to the one-year anniversary of hiatus).

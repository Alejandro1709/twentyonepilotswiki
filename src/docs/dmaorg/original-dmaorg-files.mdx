## 988 06MOON 18 - Josh’s birthday

[![cla_ncy-988-06MOON_18_-1](./assets/cla_ncy-988-06MOON_18_-1.jpg)](./assets/cla_ncy-988-06MOON_18_-1.jpg)


**File name**: cla_ncy-988-06MOON_18_-1.jpg

**Additional Info:**
- This date (June 18 1988) is Josh’s birthday

- The handwriting on the right side of the page spells “WEST WALL BLOCKED / EAST IS UP.” It’s different handwriting than the one in Clancy’s signature, and it’s suspected to be Josh’s handwriting. 

- The metadata of the file shows a hidden date: cla_ncy-009-06MOON_14_-1 (June 14th, 2009). This is suspected to be the founding of the band and seems to be around the time when they purchased the ‘band house.’


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![meta data gif](./assets/metadata.gif)](./assets/metadata.gif)

- Trivia: Older videos from the band (such as “Goner” and “Truce”) were filmed in a street called “Clancy Way” in Columbus, Ohio.

- Note: In the last paragraph, there is a mistake where Clancy writes “inhabitants his region” instead of “inhabitants *of* his region” or “inhabit*ing* his region.”

**Transcription of the letter**
> ”The perplexities of the Dema horizon didn't occur to me until my ninth year. It was then that I began to contemplate the existential, and decide what type of impression I wanted my life to make. Naturally, to fuel my hope, I looked out upon the distance of the land that had cultivated me, only this time with new awareness of the obstruction that my youthful ignorance had allowed me to overlook. Was it there the whole time? How had I not seen something so obvious? I am reminded of the moment daily, as the realization directly collides with a unique hope for my own future. As a child, I looked upon Dema with wonder, today, I am wrought with frustration, as I spend each day squinting for a glimpse of the top of the looming wall that has kept us here. It was upon my ninth year that I learned that Dema wasn't my home. This village, after all of this time, was my trap. 
>
> Before I became realized, I had deep affection for Dema. There was a wonderful structure to the city that put my cares to rest. Streets and locations were dependable, and the responsibilities of the day seemed to be accomplished with minimal effort. Once a task was taught and understood, we delighted in our ability to complete our obligations timely, and felt secure in knowing tomorrow's duties would be accomplished with the same efficiency. We all worked to represent our bishop with honor, and knew that each inhabitant of our region had a like-minded dedication to consistency.
>
> Keons embodied the spirit of this dedication. Of Dema's nine bishops, Keons  was revered as unwavering and forthright, possessing the ability to achieve focus that was rare for most in our region. We all admired him, and felt honored to be inhabitants his region. While we had heard legend of the ruthlessness of other bishops, Keons possessed a stoic demeanor unlike anyone I had ever met, and we were all proud to serve.”

## 011 07MOON 08 - Regional at Best release date

**File name:** se__elf.jpg

- This picture is a halftoned, cropped version of a photo featuring Andre Weil (right, taken 31 December 1955) and a child covering the face, whose identity is yet unknown. Andre Weil was a famous mathematician who had found scientific evidence for the existence of God and also invented the null sign “∅” (used on the TØP official logo). He was also a member of a group called Nicolas Bourbaki.

## 013 01MOON 08 - Vessel release date 
[![_ti_su_p.png](./assets/_ti_su_p.png)](./assets/_ti_su_p.png)

**File name:** _ti_su_p.png

**Additional Info:**

- The date (January 8 2013) is the Vessel release date
- The picture has the following caption: sev_ering__tiez

- The map shows a simplified, birds’ eye view of the ‘Sacred Municipality of DEMA,’ strongly resembling the structure of a Tower of Silence.
- The missing corner of the map contained a compass hidden through transparency that could only be revealed by recolouring the blank space of the the original image that was posted. The map displayed on the site now does not have this corner anymore.

[![mapcorner](./assets/mapcorner.png)](./assets/mapcorner.png)

- Nine circles, along with nine names, are visible in the center of the map--one for each song on the Blurryface album cover and each respective Bishop.

The text under the map and its caption says:
> gEt out. the compAss lies. they don't control you. get out. the compaSs lies. They don't control you. get out. the compass lIeS. they don't control yoU.get out. the comPass lies. they don't control you.

The text once again hints that EAST IS UP with capital letters. When the map is turned so that east is up, the nine circles and their names then correspond with the nine circles on the Blurryface album cover, each representing one song. Moreover, the name written beside each circle corresponds with lyrics from the respective song.

:::note
The only name that never matched any lyrics was Nico, which should have corresponded to the song “Stressed Out.” Originally, it was thought to be “Nigo,” but even then, it still would not have fit the lyrics, as they are “when i get older,” not “got older.”*
:::

In the Dema universe, each name on the map corresponds to a Bishop, and each Bishop has a district in Dema.

The violation code also corresponds to the track numbers of the songs displayed on the cover of *Blurryface.*

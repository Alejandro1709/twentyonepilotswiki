**File name:** _e_sr__eve_r_.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The lines from this journal were stripped and put together to spell a hidden message, visible only with the yellow tape image available in the same update.

- The yellow tape highlights the message “WE ARE BANDITOS” vertically, in reference to the audio file found in [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). As the file name suggests, you need to “reverse” the audio to hear the message.

**Transcription of the letter:**
> “A lifeless light surrounds us each night. Never could I imagine that // something so luminous could feel so dark. It's this glow that reminds // us of the dreamless existence we've been sentenced to. But what I call // a sentence, others accept as normalcy. How did they so efficiently // eradicate the dreams within us? When the bishops instituted Vialism // as mandate, they effectively reversed the hope that many arrived with. // Am I the only one who realizes that we've been lied to? Am I the only // one not afraid of the notion that the nine have hijacked our trust, // and extinguished the hope that once motivated our existence? We used // to close our eyes and picture a better life, now this city is full of // dry eyes caught in a trance of obedience, devoid of any trace of an // identity. The only significant light I've seen has been in the eyes of // those smeared - such a curious sight, to see bright eyes strangled by // the darkness of bishop hands. As their penance fades, so dims their // memory of something more. My hope of something more is all I have in // this rigid tomb, and I will not let it die.

- The yellow tapes highlight the message “WE ARE BANDITOS” when you overlay the file over the third Clancy letter.

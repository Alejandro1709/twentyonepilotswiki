[![Alt text: Half tone image on white background showing a group of people standing at the top of a cliff. Perspective of the shot is like someone at the bottom of the cliff looking up at them. Same setting as the Jumpsuit music video.](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)

**File name:** 2018_514_3_8.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The picture has the following caption: __n_ot_myo_nly_fri_en d
- The file name 2018_514_3_8 translates to tr_en_c_h (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)
- When you put “2018_514_3_8” into the url, substituting the violation code, you will get: [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). The link has an 8-second audio file of a distorted voice saying something that sounds like “so did they obey/bury/buy you.” After heavily editing the recording, it is possible to hear Tyler’s voice.
- UPDATE: After the update on July 1st, it is revealed that the audio clip is “We are banditos” but reversed.
- The audio link also works with[: http://dmaorg.info/found/trench/clancy.html](http://dmaorg.info/found/trench/clancy.html)
- The audio--or at least the same phrase--is used on the new song “Nico and the Niners” at 3:31 - 3:34.
- A crosshair is visible near the middle of the image, blended into the half-tone shading of the rocks.
- This update correlates to the fourth eye tweet, from “Truce”: “*I will fear the night again”*.
- It seems as if they tried to recreate the vulture photo (unnamed (1)) as when overlayed over each other, the positions of each figure seem to match up pretty closely with the vultures.

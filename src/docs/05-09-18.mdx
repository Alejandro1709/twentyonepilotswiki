017 07MOON 07 - First official day of hiatus

Additional Info:
- Some letters in the journal were purposefully blanked out to spell the message “YOU ARE STILL SLEEPING.”

- This update correlates to the second eye tweet, from “Oh Ms Believer”: “My pretty sleeper.”

:::note There are a few grammatical errors.
1. “gets” instead of “get”
2. “myself; A better” instead of “myself; a better”
